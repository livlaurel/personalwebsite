# My Personal Website 🍵

[**olaurel.dev**](https://www.olaurel.dev/)

My little corner of the internet where I share my projects, inspirations, and a glimpse into who I am as a front-end developer and designer.

---

## Overview
This website is my digital journal of my journey as a developer. It reflects my growth, interests, and design style: calm, cozy, and approachable. My goal is to create a space that’s inviting, simple to navigate, and full of personality.

---

## 🎋 Inspiration
I wanted my website to feel **calm, cozy, and personal**, inspired by:  

- **Cozy, minimalist websites** like [Cozy Leigh Studios](https://cozyleigh.studio/en-mx?srsltid=AfmBOoqSsfImtIkSucaFKKVUFXvJ0sQCdtKREktKcSqEz1_8dr-rbRZ7) by Maisy Leigh. Her design emphasizes comfort and clarity in a chaotic digital world.  
- **Nature and soft color palettes** that feel warm and relaxing.  
- **Simple but expressive layouts** that make the user experience smooth and enjoyable.

I aimed to create a space where visitors can slow down and enjoy a little pocket of peace online.

## 💻 What I Built
I designed and developed the site using:  

- **React + Vite** – for a fast, lightweight front-end  
- **Tailwind CSS** – for responsive styling  

### Key Features
- **About Me** – Introduction to who I am and my background  
- **Projects** – Showcasing personal and professional work  
- **Inspiration** – Visual collection of colors, designs, and ideas that inspire me

## 🛠 Challenges & Solutions
The first version of my website didn’t feel like “me.” It was rushed, unfinished, and uninspired. I decided to **start over completely**, this time planning the design first using Canva and gathering feedback from web developers and UX/UI designers.  

This approach allowed me to:  
- Build a more **user-friendly and cohesive site**  
- Code with a **clear vision and structure**  
- Create a final product that reflects my personality and style

## 🌿 Results
> The end result is a **cozy, zen, and personal website** that I’m proud of. It’s not just a portfolio—it’s a space that makes me happy and, I hope, makes visitors feel the same.

## 💡 Key Learnings
- **Starting over is okay** – a fresh start can lead to better results  
- **Ask for help** – advice from experienced designers was invaluable  
- **Design first, code second** – planning makes development smoother  
- **Keep learning** – I gained new skills in UI/UX and front-end development
